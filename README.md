# NLP Slack Project

## What is this?

A project for generating art through your Slack messages.

## Why?

I wanted to get some more experience working with NLP and sentiment analysis as well as Cloud (and LocalStack), modern front end frameworks, creative coding with [p5](https://p5js.org/), and monorepo management with [Lerna](https://github.com/lerna/lerna).

The end result of this project is that someone with an AWS and Slack account could fire it up and create their own art with it.
